                <h2>Sirmaur</h2>
                <p>
Sirmaur lies at the lower edge of Himachal, where the plains slowly rise into hills. Around Paonta Sahib, the land is flat and warm. As you move up towards Nahan, pine trees begin to appear, and the air feels lighter. Higher still, near Haripurdhar and Churdhar, the slopes turn cold and full of orchards. Churdhar is the highest point here, a sacred peak where people still walk for days to visit Lord Shiva.
<br><br>
The Yamuna and Giri rivers flow along its sides, and small streams around Renuka and Markanda keep the fields green.Monsoon can be heavy here, blocking roads, while higher villages see snow for a short time in winter.

                <!-- <h2>Our Hidden Favourites</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sherpa Eco Resort, Solan</strong> – A quiet hillside retreat where mornings start with mist and end with bonfire chatter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aunty ka Dhaba, Chail</strong> – No menus, just simple food made with love. You’ll remember her parathas longer than you expect.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chai stall near Jatoli Temple</strong> – Tea that tastes better because of temple bells in the background.</li>
                    <li><strong>Phantom Hill, Solan</strong> – A forgotten ridge with a view that feels like it’s yours alone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Karol ka Tibba</strong> – A trek where the climb is tough, but the silence at the top teaches you something about yourself.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kaali ka Tibba, Chail</strong> – A hilltop temple where the sky seems wider than anywhere else.</li>
                </ul> -->
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="centered-info-block">
            <h2>Towns & Villages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nahan</strong> - The district headquarters and old capital. You’ll find government offices, colleges, and the main markets here. Rani Tal and Pakka Talab are the town’s landmarks, surrounded by old temples and houses. Mall Road and the Chaugan are evening walking areas. The Pakka Talab mandi is where farmers bring vegetables, pulses and the well-known "Nahan haldi" from nearby fields. Life here is simple: people go to work, students fill the road after college, and most social time is spent between tea stalls, small restaurants, and temple courtyards.</li>
                <li><strong>Renuka Valley (Dadahu–Renuka Ji)</strong> - About 40 km from Nahan, the road drops into the Renuka valley. Renuka Ji is Sirmaur’s most important lake and pilgrimage spot, linked to the story of Renuka and her son Parshuram. The Renuka temple stands right by the water. A big fair after Diwali brings people from all over the district for holy baths, stalls, wrestling matches, folk dances, and a lot of food. Around the lake you’ll see paddy fields, maize, small homestays, and the wildlife sanctuary on the slopes. Renuka’s own market is tiny; people usually go to Dadahu or Nahan for bigger needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Rajgarh & Pachaad side</strong> - Rajgarh sits in a cooler, greener belt and is often called "Peach Valley". Orchards of peach, plum and apple surround the villages. Many families here are Khash Rajputs who run farms and orchards. Local faith centres around Shirgul Dev (a form of Shiva) and village goddesses, and there is a strong connection to the Churdhar side. Mornings are for milk collection, mandis and field work; by afternoon, schools, buses and chai shops take over. A lot of youth from this side serve in the Army or work in Shimla, Solan or Chandigarh and come back for harvests and festivals.</li>
                <li><strong>Paonta Sahib</strong> - Paonta Sahib lies on the Yamuna plain and feels closer to Punjab and Haryana in weather and lifestyle. Guru Gobind Singh stayed here for years; the town is built around the Gurudwara Paonta Sahib on the riverbank. There’s also an old Vishnu temple nearby. Sal forests, factories and the industrial area surround the town. The main market is busy and mixed – local vegetables, grains, fish from the Yamuna, Punjabi snacks, clothes and hardware. There are colleges and a Sanskrit pathshala, and many people work in cement, power, or cross daily into Yamuna Nagar for jobs.</li>
                <li><strong>Shillai–Sangrah (Trans-Giri)</strong> - The Shillai–Sangrah side is more remote and hilly. Shillai town sits high on a ridge; below and around it lie dozens of Hatti villages, with terraced fields of barley, buckwheat, and apple and walnut trees. This area has its own social rules and traditions, including older practices such as joint marriages. Sangrah has a college and acts as a centre for nearby villages. Weekly haats in Shillai and Sangrah are important – people come on foot or by jeep to buy ration, clothes, and tools. Roads here connect to Paonta, Nahan and Shimla, but during heavy rain they can be fragile.</li>
                <li><strong>Other important spots</strong> - Trilokpur, near the plains side, is known for the Bala Sundari temple and its Navratri fairs. Nahan hosts the Bawan Dwadashi fair, during which idols of many village deities are brought to Rani Tal. Smaller villages like Pachhota and Jawalamukhi have their own fairs and weekly markets. In most of Sirmaur, life still revolves around the village temple or gurudwara, the local dhaba, and the nearest bus stop.</li>

                <h2>Culture & Festivals</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bishu (Bisu)</strong> – Spring festival around April–May. Villagers worship the local deity, then organize Thoda fairs – mock battles with bows and arrows between village teams, accompanied by drums and folk songs. This marks the new agricultural year.</li>
                    <li><strong>Haryali</strong> – Celebrated mid-July when fields are green. Farmers take their Kul Devta in a palanquin through the fields, singing rain songs. It includes simple feasts and naati dances in courtyards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sair</strong> – Harvest festival in mid-September. Families carry the season’s first walnuts, apples, and wild herbs to the local shrine. These are offered to the devta and then shared among relatives and neighbours.</li>
                    <li><strong>Budi Diwali (Manshaari)</strong> – A second Diwali, celebrated a month after the main Diwali by Hatti villages in Trans-Giri for several days and nights. Families prepare special dishes, light bonfires, perform small havans, and dance in circles. Married daughters usually return home for this festival.</li>
                    <li><strong>Renuka Fair</strong> – A five-day fair at Renuka Ji held after Diwali. The idol of Parshuram is brought to "meet" his mother Renuka at the lake, involving holy dips, Thoda displays, wrestling, and folk dances.</li>
                    <li><strong>Other Fairs</strong> – Include Gugga-Navmi at serpent shrines, Navratri melas at Trilokpur and Nahan, and smaller gatherings for Holi and Shivratri. Music, naati, and drums are central to all these celebrations.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="right-side">

                    <li><strong>Schooling:</strong> Most big villages have a primary school, and towns have higher secondary schools.</li>
                    <li><strong>Higher Education Options:</strong> Students typically attend:

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Further Studies:</strong> Many young people move to Shimla, Chandigarh, Dehradun, or Delhi for advanced education.</li>
                    <li><strong>Career Focus:</strong> A good number of youth join the Army, paramilitary forces, or police. Girls increasingly work as teachers, nurses, clerks, and bank staff.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Employment:</strong> Those who stay are involved in orchards/farming, local business/transport, Paonta's industrial area, or tourism/homestays (Renuka, Rajgarh, Sarahan).</li>

                <h2>Religious Beliefs</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Local Deities:</strong> Religion is a mix of formal temples and strong local beliefs. Almost every village has a Kul Devta or Kul Devi (family deity). These shrines range from full temples to small structures under a tree.</li>
                    <li><strong>Major Temples:</strong> Key temples include <strong>Bala Sundari at Trilokpur</strong>, Shiv temples around Nahan, and the <strong>Renuka Ji temple</strong> by the lake. People organize yearly raats (night gatherings) with bhajans and simple meals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sikh Center:</strong> Paonta Sahib's Gurudwara is a major Sikh center. The Langar (community kitchen) runs daily and is open to everyone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Other Faiths:</strong> There are also old Muslim shrines and dargahs in the lower belt, visited quietly by local families.</li>
                    <li><strong>Folk Practices:</strong> Folk practices are still strong. People may visit a <strong>jhagat (village oracle)</strong> for difficult problems, or keep ash from a Shiva temple for home rituals. Locals avoid cutting certain trees on auspicious days.</li>
                    <li><strong>Traditions:</strong> Stories of Renuka, Parshuram, and Shirgul dev are central to local upbringing. Newborns and newly married couples are often taken first to the home devta before any big plan.</li>

        <h2>Respect & Etiquette</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Greetings:</strong> Greet elders with "Ram Ram ji" or "Namaste" using folded hands. People here are straightforward and welcoming, but value simple manners.</li>
            <li><strong>Sacred Spaces:</strong> Remove shoes before entering homes, temples, and gurudwaras. In temples, speak softly and avoid pushing during rituals. In a gurudwara, cover your head, sit on the floor, and don’t point your feet towards the Guru Granth Sahib.</li>
            <li><strong>Littering:</strong> Do not litter; carry your wrappers and bottles back with you.</li>
            <li><strong>Photography:</strong> Always ask permission before clicking photos of people, homes, or rituals.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Conduct:</strong> Bargaining is fine, but keep your tone light and respectful.</li>
            <li><strong>Festival Conduct:</strong> During festival times, locals expect basic respect around shrines – no shouting, no climbing on platforms, and no shoes near idols.</li>
            <li><strong>General Attitude:</strong> Approach with patience, curiosity about local ways, and respect for elders and deities.</li>
