                <h2>Shimla</h2>
                <p>Shimla is the capital of Himachal and a district that stretches from apple valleys to high ridges, carrying both colonial buildings and village life. Government offices run here, but so do apple mandis. Markets crowd the lanes, yet a short drive can take you to villages where time feels slower.
</p>                
                <h2>Our Hidden Favourites (Himachalites Recommended)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shali Tibba Trek</strong> - The highest peak above Shimla. A $5–6\text{ km}$ walk from Khatnol through cedar forests. Go for sunrise. At the top, a small Bhimakali temple and a silence you’ll remember. Please don’t treat it like a picnic spot. Carry your waste back.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cheog near Fagu</strong> - A quiet village with apple orchards, homestays, and even treehouses. A good stop if you want village life close to Shimla.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tattapani</strong> - Natural hot water springs by the Sutlej. Locals believe they heal joint pains. River rafting is popular here too.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bantony Castle</strong> - An old British estate right in Shimla town. Less talked about, but worth a visit if you want to see a quieter part of heritage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chadwick Falls</strong> - A short hike from Summer Hill. Best after rain when the fall is full. Go early in the morning to avoid crowds.</li>

                <h2>Respect & Etiquette</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>General Approach:</strong> Please treat these spaces with respect, not as picnic spots. Walk softly; don’t impose yourself. Let the place reveal what it wants to show you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sacred Spaces & Dress Code:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Come clean:</strong> Avoid alcohol, meat/non-veg, and eggs before visiting temples.</li>
                            <li><strong>Silence matters:</strong> Don’t blast music or turn temple surroundings into a picnic ground. Quiet is part of the experience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Menstruation Note:</strong> In many villages, customs suggest women avoid visiting sacred sites during menstruation. This follows age-old traditions where the community sees these places as deeply charged.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Water Bodies:</strong> Stay away from streams, rivers, or ponds unless locals say it’s safe or respectful to enter. Never jump into sacred ponds or springs without permission, as some are reserved for rituals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Guidance & Safety:</strong> Ask before you enter or participate; local guidance will help you avoid mistakes and keep you safe.</li>
                    <li><strong>Environmental Responsibility:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Don’t litter:</strong> Carry back everything you bring. Please don’t leave chip packets, bottles, diapers, pads, or plastics behind.</li>
                            <li><strong>Leave lighter than you arrived:</strong> Your respect keeps the mountains alive for those who come after you.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Respect & Etiquette</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Greetings:</strong> Greet elders with "Ram Ram ji" or "Namaste" using folded hands. People here are straightforward and welcoming, but value simple manners.</li>
            <li><strong>Sacred Spaces:</strong> Remove shoes before entering homes, temples, and gurudwaras. In temples, speak softly and avoid pushing during rituals. In a gurudwara, cover your head, sit on the floor, and don’t point your feet towards the Guru Granth Sahib.</li>
            <li><strong>Littering:</strong> Do not litter; carry your wrappers and bottles back with you.</li>
            <li><strong>Photography:</strong> Always ask permission before clicking photos of people, homes, or rituals.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Conduct:</strong> Bargaining is fine, but keep your tone light and respectful.</li>
            <li><strong>Festival Conduct:</strong> During festival times, locals expect basic respect around shrines – no shouting, no climbing on platforms, and no shoes near idols.</li>
            <li><strong>General Attitude:</strong> Approach with patience, curiosity about local ways, and respect for elders and deities.</li>
