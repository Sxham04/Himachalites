                <h2>Kullu</h2>
                <p>Kullu is the Beas valley belt of Himachal – orchards on both sides of the river and high ranges all around. Lower parts are warm enough for paddy and vegetables; a little higher you get deodar forests and apple trees; above that are meadows, passes and snow.
                    <br><br>
                The main valley follows the Beas from Bhuntar to Manali. From this, side valleys open out: Parvati (towards Manikaran), Tirthan and Sainj (towards the Great Himalayan National Park side), Lug valley above Kullu, and Banjar–Seraj beyond Aut. People here speak Kullvi/Pahari at home and Hindi with visitors. Apple, rajma, tourism and small trade are the main livelihoods.    
                </p>                
                <!-- <h2>Our Hidden Favourites (Himachalites Recommended)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shali Tibba Trek</strong> - The highest peak above Shimla. A $5–6\text{ km}$ walk from Khatnol through cedar forests. Go for sunrise. At the top, a small Bhimakali temple and a silence you’ll remember. Please don’t treat it like a picnic spot. Carry your waste back.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cheog near Fagu</strong> - A quiet village with apple orchards, homestays, and even treehouses. A good stop if you want village life close to Shimla.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tattapani</strong> - Natural hot water springs by the Sutlej. Locals believe they heal joint pains. River rafting is popular here too.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bantony Castle</strong> - An old British estate right in Shimla town. Less talked about, but worth a visit if you want to see a quieter part of heritage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chadwick Falls</strong> - A short hike from Summer Hill. Best after rain when the fall is full. Go early in the morning to avoid crowds.</li>

                <li><strong>Beas Valley - Bhuntar, Kullu, Manali</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Bhuntar:</strong> The first proper town entering Kullu from Mandi. It has the airport, a busy bazaar, and serves as the junction where the road splits for Manali and Parvati Valley.</li>

                        <li><strong>Kasol–Tosh–Pulga–Barshaini:</strong> These are local home villages. Families here run small guesthouses or cafés during the season and rely on farming (apples, pulses, vegetables) the rest of the year.</li>

                </li>
                <li><strong>Tirthan & Sainj (GHNP side)</strong>

                        <li><strong>Tirthan valley:</strong> Known for trout and access to the Great Himalayan National Park (GHNP). Villages (Gushaini, Nagini) have orchards, homestays, and old wooden temples. Life is slow, focused on fishing and farming.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sainj valley:</strong> Features terraced fields, traditional houses, and big deodar patches. Sainj has an old temple and small bazaar. Villages like Shangarh have wide, grassy grounds and local *devta* temples.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Banjar–Seraj & Lug Valley</strong>

                        <li><strong>Lug valley:</strong> A more traditional area above Kullu town. Villages focus on livestock, maize, pulses, and forestry. Roads are steep and often rely on mule tracks.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <h2>Culture & Festivals</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Devta Tradition:</strong> People in Kullu strongly follow the devta tradition. Every village has its own devta or devi. The deity has a temple house ("kothi"), a palanquin, and a staff. Major community decisions (road cutting, forest use, disputes) are often guided by "asking the devta" through the *gur* (oracle).</li>
                    <li><strong>Kullu Dussehra (Dhalpur):</strong> Starts on Vijayadashami and runs for about a week. Raghunathji’s chariot is placed at Dhalpur ground, and devtas from $200–300$ villages arrive with their followers and drums. It is a major political, social, and religious gathering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Phaag / Phagli (Feb–Mar):</strong> Spring festival where villagers perform *Raksh Khel* (folk drama of demons being defeated) and *Gur Khel* (oracle dance). This ritual cleanses the village of bad energy ("dosh") before the spring sowing begins.</li>
                    <li><strong>Brishu / Jatra (Apr–May):</strong> Village devtas go on a tour (yatra) of their area to visit other shrines. People host the devta at their homes, serve food, and seek blessings for a bountiful harvest and good health.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Fairs:</strong> Include Lokshe Jatra at Naggar (around Holi), Sainj Fair (Baisakh, Apr–May) at Sainj temple, and Bhadoli Fair (once in three years) linked with sage Parshuram. Smaller *melas* are held to mark temple anniversaries, harvest, or Navratri.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mainstream Festivals:</strong> Traditional Hindu festivals like Diwali, Navratri, and Holi are celebrated, but in most villages, they are mixed with local devta customs, special *puja*, and community feasts.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="right-side">
                <h2>Education & Youth</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Schooling Network:</strong> Kullu has a good spread of schools, including Government senior secondary schools in most blocks, and private schools concentrated around Kullu, Bhuntar, and Manali.</li>
                    <li><strong>Higher & Vocational Education:</strong> The district offers a government degree college in Kullu town, along with polytechnic and ITI trade programs. Private colleges near Manali/Naggar provide courses in hotel management, IT, and commerce.</li>
                    <li><strong>Agricultural Training:</strong> Horticulture and agriculture departments run short courses focused on local skills like pruning, grafting, beekeeping, and vegetable farming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Migration & Career Focus:</strong> Many students still travel to Shimla, Chandigarh, or plains universities for specialized higher studies. Families encourage careers in engineering, nursing, teaching, the army, the police, and bank jobs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Entrepreneurship:</strong> A notable number of youth are choosing to stay and build local businesses, including running homestays, cafés, and adventure companies, or starting nurseries, mushroom units, and beekeeping. They also work as trekking and rafting guides in Tirthan, Sainj, Parvati, and the upper Beas valleys.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sports and Culture:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Local grounds host tournaments for volleyball, football, and kabaddi.</li>
                            <li>Many villages feature small gyms and outdoor gym equipment funded by local bodies.</li>
                            <li>College youth actively run cultural clubs to preserve and perform Kullu *natti* (folk dance), traditional dress, and drama.</li>

                <h2>Religious Beliefs</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"Dev Bhoomi" Identity:</strong> Kullu is often called "Dev Bhoomi" and "Valley of Gods." This is central to local life.</li>
                    <li><strong>Raghunathji (Main Deity):</strong> <strong>Raghunathji</strong> in Kullu town is seen as the main *devta* (deity) of the valley. His temple at Dhalpur is the focal point of Kullu Dussehra.</li>
                    <li><strong>Key Temples & Shrines:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Bijli Mahadev:</strong> A Shiva temple on the opposite ridge where lightning is believed to strike the *shivling* occasionally.</li>
                            <li><strong>Manali Area:</strong> Includes the temples of Hadimba Devi, Manu, and Vashisht (known for hot springs), and old Naggar temples like Tripura Sundari.</li>
                            <li><strong>Manikaran:</strong> In Parvati valley, it features both a Gurudwara and Shiva/Ram temples. Locals frequently visit for dips and *langar* (community meal).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Village Devtas and Rituals:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Every village has its own smaller *devta* temple, sometimes with a sacred grove near a spring or large tree.</li>
                            <li>Before major activities (starting construction, shifting land), a small *puja* is usually performed there.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Devtas as Living Beings:</strong> Devtas are treated as living beings. They "travel" in palanquins, "speak" through the *gur* (oracle), and can be "angry" if village rules are broken. This belief still shapes local decisions; many road or dam projects have had to change their plans after a *devta hukam* (order).</li>

                    <li><strong>Summer (May-June):</strong> Sowing in upper fields, cattle grazing in high pastures, early fruit harvest, and peak tourism on the Manali side.</li>
                    <li><strong>Monsoon (July-Sept):</strong> The main apple harvest season, characterized by trucks loaded with fruit, requiring intense orchard work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Autumn (Oct-Nov):</strong> Kullu Dussehra and local *melas*. Maize and paddy are threshed and stored, and families repair houses before winter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Winter (Dec-Jan):</strong> Quieter season. Snow falls in upper areas. Locals gather around a *bukhari* or *tandoor* to knit and plan the next season.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Etiquette for Sacred Spaces:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>General Rule:</strong> Treat these spaces with respect, not as picnic spots. Walk softly; do not impose yourself.</li>
                    <li><strong>Temple Conduct:</strong> Come clean. Avoid alcohol, meat/non-veg, and eggs before visiting. Silence matters; do not blast music near temples.</li>
                    <li><strong>Women's Customs:</strong> In many villages, women avoid visiting sacred sites during menstruation, following age-old traditions of approaching such places with clarity and respect.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water Bodies:</strong> Respect streams, rivers, and ponds. Never jump into sacred springs without local permission, as some are reserved for rituals.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Responsibility:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Do not litter:</strong> Carry back all waste (plastics, wrappers, etc.). Leave lighter than you arrived.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Guidance:</strong> Ask before you enter or participate; local guidance helps ensure safety and respect for local customs.</li>
                </ul>
