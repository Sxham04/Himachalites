                <h2>Mandi District</h2>
                <p>
Mandi is in the heart of Himachal, spread between low valleys and high ridges. The northern side rises sharply towards the Dhauladhar range, where peaks like Nagru reach over 4,000 metres. Down south, the Shivalik hills slope gently into warmer plains. Between them are wide valleys like Balh near Sundernagar and Chauntra near Jogindernagar, both known for fertile fields that feed much of the district.
<br><br>
The Beas River cuts through most of Mandi, joined by many smaller streams, while the Satluj marks its southern edge. Lakes such as Rewalsar, Prashar, and Kamrunag add quiet charm to the higher regions, and Pandoh has one of the state’s largest artificial reservoirs. Summers are warm in the valleys, monsoon rains are heavy, and snow starts above 1,500 to 2,000 metres in winter.

                <li><strong>The Seraj valley</strong> - Covering Janjehli and Thachi, has terraced fields of apples, peas, and vegetables. People here keep cattle and worship at hilltop shrines like Shikari Devi.</li>
                <li><strong>Barot</strong> - At about 1,835 meters, is a quiet settlement in the inner Dhauladhar ranges. It has a British-era reservoir, a trout breeding farm, and green fields of potatoes and peas.</li>
                <li><strong>Weekly markets</strong> - Or haats, are still held in towns like Mandi and Jogindernagar. In smaller villages, people gather on fixed days to trade food grains, tools, and household goods.</li>

                    <li><strong>Career Paths:</strong> Some young people work in the army or police, others move to cities for IT and teaching jobs, and a few go abroad. During the summer, many from nearby villages work in the tourism sector around Kullu–Manali.</li>

                <h2>Food & Markets</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Daily Meals:</strong> Food in Mandi is simple but hearty. Daily meals include rice, lentils, and vegetables cooked in ghee, with corn or buckwheat rotis in colder months.</li>
                    <li><strong>Traditional Feast (Dhaam):</strong> During weddings and special occasions, people serve the traditional Dhaam on leaf plates. It begins with something sweet and continues with rice, rajma, chana, kadhi, khatta, and sepu wadi, soft lentil-spinach dumplings cooked in gravy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Breakfast and Snacks:</strong> Breakfasts often include siddu, steamed wheat bread filled with walnuts or lentils, or patande, thin pancakes made with flour. Babru, a fried bread stuffed with spiced black gram, is a a common snack.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Delicacies:</strong> During the monsoon, locals collect wild mushrooms (gucchi) and cook them with onions or gravy. In Barot and nearby areas, fresh trout from the Uhl River is served fried or curried. Sweets like gulgule (fried wheat and jaggery balls) are made for birthdays or festivals, and a cup of milky tea is offered to every guest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Farming Hub:</strong> Mandi's economy depends heavily on farming. The wide Balh Valley, often called the "mini Punjab of Mandi," produces large amounts of tomatoes (more than three lakh crates every summer) along with cauliflower, maize, and ginger.</li>
                    <li><strong>High Valley Produce:</strong> In the higher valleys like Barot, people grow peas, potatoes, and pulses. Apple and plum orchards dot the hill slopes, and villagers collect herbs and wild honey to sell in the towns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weekly Trade:</strong> Weekly markets (or haats) in Jogindernagar and other blocks sell local produce, rajma, chillies, and handwoven woollens. Woodcraft from walnut trees, wool caps, shawls, and small brass utensils are made and sold locally.</li>

                    <li><strong>Local Customs:</strong> Before ploughing or cutting a tree, locals still offer rice or liquor to the spirits of the land.
