                <h2>Kangra</h2>
                <p>Kangra is Himachal’s wide valley district, spread between low Shivalik hills and the high Dhauladhar range. It has everything in one place: tea gardens, old forts, Tibetan monasteries, busy markets, and quiet rural belts. People here live between farming, small businesses, government jobs, and seasonal tourism. Life feels more spread out than in other districts; one side touches Punjab’s plains, the other side looks straight at the snow.
</p>                
                <h2>Our Hidden Favourites</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Masroor Rock-Cut Temples</strong> - About 35 km from Kangra town, Masroor is a group of stone temples carved from a single rock. Many outsiders miss it. Locals go there for quiet darshan and to sit by the small water tank in front.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bathu Ki Ladi</strong> - In the Pong Dam backwaters, the Bathu temples stay underwater most of the year. When water levels fall (usually late spring or summer), the stone temples stand out again. People from nearby villages go by boat or track to visit. It is very seasonal and very local.</li>
                    <li><strong>Neugal & Gunehar side</strong> - Around Gopalpur and Bir, short walks lead to small spots locals like Neugal-side temples and Gunehar waterfall. These are simple picnic or walk places, not developed tourist spots.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sidhbari & Gopalpur</strong> - Sidhbari has the Chinmaya Mission temple with its golden idol, and views of the Dhauladhar. Gopalpur is a calm village with a zoo nearby and trail starts for local hikes. Many people from Dharamshala area go here on Sundays rather than to the more crowded McLeod market.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Daily-Use Spots</strong> - There are many more such "daily-use" places, small ridge temples, village ponds, and local mela grounds that matter more to people here than the main tourism points.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="centered-info-block">
            <h2>Towns & Villages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kangra Town (Tira Kangra)</strong> - Sits below the old, large <strong>Kangra Fort</strong>, the main landmark. The bazaars (Lamba Market and Kotwali) are for locals, selling everything from groceries to Kangri paintings. It feels like a working town.</li>
                <li><strong>Dharamshala & McLeod Ganj</strong> - <strong>Lower Dharamshala</strong> (HQ) holds courts, offices, and the main bus stand. <strong>Upper Dharamshala (McLeod Ganj)</strong> hosts the Dalai Lama's residence, monasteries, and Tibetan shops. Local Himachali life blends into the background behind the main tourist streets.</li>
                <li><strong>Palampur</strong> - Known for its <strong>tea gardens</strong> and mild weather. Canals run through the fields where people grow maize, wheat, and vegetables alongside tea. It is also a key education hub, giving it a lively student population.</li>
                <li><strong>Baijnath</strong> - A smaller town famous for its ancient <strong>Shiva temple</strong>. Outside of major festivals, it remains a quiet place with a main market and the river nearby.</li>
                <li><strong>Nurpur & Dera Gopipur</strong> - <strong>Nurpur</strong> is close to the Punjab border, featuring an old fort and temple. <strong>Dera Gopipur</strong>, on the Beas, is slower, known for riverside ghats and old temples.</li>
                <li><strong>Andretta, Bir, Pragpur–Garli</strong> - 
                    <br><strong>Andretta:</strong> An art and pottery village. Norah Richards and later Sobha Singh made it an artist’s pocket in the valley. Today, pottery workshops and small homestays keep that culture alive.
                    <br><strong>Bir:</strong> Started as a quiet village with fields and monasteries. Now it is known for paragliding, but behind the main road, it is still just a Himachali–Tibetan village with cows, wheat fields, and monks walking to prayer.
                    <br><strong>Pragpur and Garli:</strong> Heritage villages with old havelis, slate roofs, and narrow streets. Families still live in these homes, run small shops, and host simple stays.
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Local Villages</strong> - Between these centers, hundreds of villages exist where daily life revolves simply around farming, school, temple, and the local market.</li>
            </ul>

                    <li><strong>Baisakhi / Biswa:</strong> Houses are cleaned, walls whitewashed, and some families take a holy dip in rivers and streams like Ban-Ganga.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sair (Harvest):</strong> A small harvest fair in mid-September where people carry fruits and grains to local temples to thank the gods for the crop.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lohri in Pragpur–Garli:</strong> Families gather around bonfires, throw peanuts and sweets into the fire, and share traditional snacks like rewri and gachak.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tibetan Festivals (McLeod Ganj):</strong> Tibetan Buddhists celebrate <strong>Losar (New Year)</strong> with butter lamps and new prayer flags, and the <strong>Himalayan Festival</strong> with folk performances and crafts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Daily Religious Life:</strong> Most religious life is simple: morning and evening aarti at village temples, occasional local jagran, and annual devta yatra (procession) when the local deity is carried around the village.</li>
