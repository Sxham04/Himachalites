An unconventional, immersive tourism platform that reimagines web navigation through a **bottom-to-top scrolling experience**. As users "ascend" through the site, they follow a dynamic, animated SVG path that guides them through featured travel destinations.

### Highlights

* **Inverted Scroll:** A unique bottom-up flow that simulates exploration and discovery.
* **Interactive SVG Path:** A dashed-line animation that draws itself in real-time based on the user's scroll progress.
* **Dynamic Tip Counter:** A rotating SVG indicator that tracks the "head" of the path, adjusting its orientation to match the curve of the line.
* **Parallax Depth:** Multi-layered visual effects that create a sense of scale and immersion as the traveler moves upward.
